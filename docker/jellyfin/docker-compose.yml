# Jellyfin – Docker Deployment

This folder contains the Docker configuration used to deploy the Jellyfin media server in my Home Lab environment.

---

## 📌 Overview

Jellyfin is an open‑source media server used to stream movies, series, and personal media across devices.  
In my Home Lab, Jellyfin runs inside a Docker container on a Linux VM managed by Proxmox.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

All Jellyfin data is stored under:

/home/danilo/docker/jellyfin/


Inside this directory:

- `config/` → Jellyfin configuration files  
- `cache/` → Transcoding and temporary data  
- `/home/danilo/media` → My media library (movies, series, music)

---

## 🐳 Docker Compose File

Below is the exact `docker-compose.yml` used in this deployment:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin:latest
    container_name: jellyfin
    network_mode: bridge
    ports:
      - "8096:8096"
    volumes:
      - /home/danilo/docker/jellyfin/config:/config
      - /home/danilo/docker/jellyfin/cache:/cache
      - /home/danilo/media:/media
    restart: unless-stopped

📡 Network
Jellyfin Web UI:
http://<server-ip>:8096

Network mode: bridge

No custom VLAN required for this service

🔄 Backups
The following folders are included in my automated rsync backup routine:
/home/danilo/docker/jellyfin/config
/home/danilo/docker/jellyfin/cache
Media files are not backed up automatically due to size.

🧪 Testing
After deploying:

Access the UI

Add /media as the main library

Validate transcoding

Test playback on mobile and TV

📈 Future Improvements
Add hardware transcoding (Intel QuickSync)

Add monitoring via Grafana + Prometheus

Move media to a dedicated NAS
